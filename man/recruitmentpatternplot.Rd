\usage{
recruitmentpatternplot(
  data,
  xlab = "Month",
  ylab = "Recruitment \%",
  scenarios = NULL,
  scenario_labels = NULL,
  scenario_order = NULL,
  ncol = 2,
  scales = "free",
  colours = c("black", "grey80", "grey20", "grey60", "grey40")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Output from recruitmentpatternplot_prep(). A dataframe with recruitment (num), months (num), monthnames (fac), scenario (fac)}

\item{xlab}{Label for x-axis (character). Default is "Month".}

\item{ylab}{Label for y-axis (character). Default is "Recruitment \%".}

\item{scenarios}{A vector of scenario numbers to be shown on plot (numeric). This was already specified in prep file, but this is a manual override to save running the prep function again.}

\item{scenario_labels}{A vector of customised scenario names (character). Default is "Scenario 1", "Scenario 2", etc.}

\item{scenario_order}{A vector to reorder how scenarios are displayed (character). Use the label names defined in "scenario_labels".
If "scenario_labels" is left blank, the labels will be "Scenario 1", "Scenario 2" etc.
Any scenarios not included in "scenario_order" will be tacked on in the order they appear in the input data.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for facet_wrap(). Default is 2.}

\item{scales}{Scales for ggplot2::facet_wrap(). Default is 'free', see ?ggplot2::facet_wrap for options.}

\item{colours}{A vector of colours used (character).}
