\arguments{
\item{data}{Output from lengthplot_prep(). A data frame with year (int), fleet (int), bin (int), sex (chr), obs (num), exp (num), scenario (int)}

\item{fleet}{Specify which fleet to plot (numeric). By default, fleet 1 will be shown.}

\item{scenario}{A scenario numbers to be shown on plot (numeric). This was already specified in prep file, but this is a manual override to save running the prep function again.}

\item{partition}{Specify which partition to plot (numeric). By default, partition 0 will be shown.}

\item{point_size}{Size of points used in ggplot2::geom_line(). Default is 1.}

\item{colours}{A vector of colours used for sex types (character).}

\item{legend_position}{Position of the legend ("none", "left", "right", "bottom", "top", or two-element numeric vector for x and y position). Default is "top".}

\item{financial_year}{Set to TRUE if the assessment was based on financial year (logical). Adjusts the x-axis to show full financial year notation.}

\item{xlab}{Label for x-axis (character). Default is "Year".}

\item{ylab}{Label for y-axis (character). Default is "Spawning biomass (relative)".+}

\item{xbreaks}{A vector of breaks between x-axis labels, used in ggplot2::scale_x_continous() (numeric).}

\item{ybreaks}{A vector of breaks between y-axis labels, used in ggplot2::scale_y_continous() (numeric).}

\item{xlabels}{A vector of labels for the x-axis breaks.}

\item{ylabels}{A vector of labels for the y-axis breaks.}

\item{xlim}{A vector of lower and upper x-axis limits (e.g. c(1950, 2020)) (numeric).}

\item{ylim}{A vector of lower and upper y-axis limits (e.g. c(0,1)) (numeric).}

\item{scales}{Scales for ggplot2::facet_wrap(). Default is 'free', see ?ggplot2::facet_wrap for options.}

\item{ncol}{Number of columns for facet_wrap(). Default is 2.}

\item{direction}{Direction of facet wrap (character). Enter "v" for vertical or "h" for horizontal.}

\item{MLS}{Value of minimum legal size (or equivalent) (numeric). Leave blank to exclude from plot.}

\item{MLS_colour}{Colour of MLS line (character). Default is "black".}

\item{MLS_label}{Label of MLS line (character). Default is "MLS".}

\item{show_fits}{Set to TRUE to show model fits.}
