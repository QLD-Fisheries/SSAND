```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```


## Let's get started...

Install the library and load it: 

```{r install, include=TRUE}
# devtools::install_github("QLD-Fisheries/SSAND")
library(SSAND)
```

Observe that data stored in the package is pre-loaded, available for use:

```{r see-data, include=TRUE}
ss_mcmc[[1]][1:3,1:3]
```

There are 5 data sets that come with SSAND, called `ss_mle`, `ss_mcmc`,`dd_mle`,`dd_mcmc` and `dd_sim`.

If you overwrite one of these variables, it saves in your environment:

```{r overwrite, include=TRUE}
ss_mcmc <- "hello"
ss_mcmc
```

But if you remove this from your environment, it reverts back to the saved SSAND data:

```{r restore, include=TRUE}
rm(ss_mcmc)
ss_mcmc[[1]][1:3,1:3]
```

Browse the functions available: 
```{r view-functions, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
ls("package:SSAND")
```

You can see what each plot looks like by running the `catalogue()` function. This produces and opens a HTML document that shows each plot in a bit more detail, to get a feel for the options available within SSAND.
```{r catalogue, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
catalogue()
```

When you find a plot you would like to use, explore the documentation for the function:

```{r documentation, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?recdevplot_prep_SS
?recdevplot
```


## Building your SSAND intuition...

A few simple rules have been made to allow users to build a bit of an intuition when using SSAND. 

### Structure

Typically, each plot requires two functions: the `prep()` function and the `plot()` function. 

* All data preparation decisions should be declared in the `prep()` file, and all plotting decisions are declared in the `plot()` function. 
* The `prep()` functions have a suffix to denote the model the data is prepared for. ``DD" means delay-difference (namely, DDUST) and ``SS" means Stock Synthesis. 
* The output of the `prep()` functions will look the same, regardless of the model used. 
* The first argument of a `prep_SS()` function will be a list of outputs from `r4ss::SS_outputs()` with one element per scenario. This is referred to as `ss_mle`
* The first argument of a `prep_DD()` function will be a list of outputs from `DDUST::makefullreport()` with one element per scenario. This is referred to as `dd_mle`. 
* If using an MCMC model, the second argument of a `prep_SS()` function will be a list of outputs from `r4ss::SSgetMCMC()` with one element per scenario. This is referred to as `ss_mcmc`.
* If using an MCMC model, the second argument of a `prep_DD()` function will be a list of model fits from `tmbstan::tmbstan()` with one list element per scenario. This is referred to as `dd_mcmc`.
* If using an MCMC model, the third argument of a `prep_DD()` function will _often_ be a list of outputs from DDUST::simulate_DD() with one list element per scenario. This is referred to as `dd_sim`. 
* The presence of `ss_mcmc` and `dd_mcmc` informs the SSAND function that an MCMC model was used.

The scenarios listed in `ss_mle` and `ss_mcmc` should align, similarly for `dd_mle`, `dd_mcmc` and `dd_sim`.  If you want to plot a subset of scenarios in these lists, this can be specified using the `scenarios` argument which is available in the `prep()` function (and a second chance available in the `plot()` function). Scenario names can be specified in the `plot()` functions using the `scenario_labels` argument. 

### Variable names 
As a user, the following guidelines will be helpful to get used to SSAND: 

* Multi-word variable names are spelled in full and separated by an underscore with the following exceptions: xlab, xbreaks, xlim, ylab, ybreaks, ylim and ncol
* Logical variables that include/exclude features have a prefix of `show_` (e.g. `show_median`)

In the back-end, the following rules are followed: 

* All variable names are to be in lower case with the following exceptions: B, F, MSY, LL, Linf, W_r. 
* Data entered into the `plot()` function should be called `data`. Incremental and final ggplot objects should be called `p`. 

## Example 1: Recruitment deviations plot

Let's plot the recruitment deviations from a Stock Synthesis model. Start by exploring the plot prep documentation: 

```{r recdevs1, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?recdevplot_prep_SS
```

Follow the guide in the example to build then plot the dataset:

```{r recdevs2, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data <- recdevplot_prep_SS(ss_mle)
head(data)
recdevplot(data)
```

Look at the plot documentation for more plotting options:

```{r recdevs3a, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?recdevplot
```

```{r recdevs3, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
recdevplot(data, scenarios = c(1,2), scenario_labels = c("This one", "That one"), ncol = 1)
```

Create the same plot, but for an MCMC dataset:
```{r recdevs4, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data <- recdevplot_prep_SS(ss_mle, ss_mcmc)
recdevplot(data)
```

Note that there are several options for displaying MCMC results. 

```{r recdevs5, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
recdevplot(data,mcmc_style= "hairy")
recdevplot(data,mcmc_style= "boxplot")
```

You also have options for which median lines to display. 

```{r recdevs6, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
recdevplot(data,mcmc_style= "hairy", show_median = "median_recdevs")
recdevplot(data,mcmc_style= "banded", show_median = "none")
recdevplot(data,mcmc_style= "banded", show_median = c("median_recdevs", "trajectory"))
```

## Example 2: Spaghetti plot

Now let's build a spaghetti plot; a plot that shows biomass trajectories for multiple scenarios. In this example, I want to make a spaghetti plot for a DDUST MCMC model. 

Start by creating the dataset: 

```{r spaghetti1, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data <- spaghettiplot_prep_DD(dd_mle)
head(data)
```

We can use the plotting function to create a standard spaghetti plot:

```{r spaghetti2a, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?spaghettiplot
```

```{r spaghetti2, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
spaghettiplot(data)
```

Or we can use another pre-built template:

```{r spaghetti3, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
spaghettiplot(data, template = "greyscale")
```

Or we can customise the colour and linetypes to group scenarios:
```{r spaghetti4, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
spaghettiplot(data,
              linetype_categories = c(1,2),
              linetype_labels = c("Catch rate A", "Catch rate B"),
              linetypes = c("solid", "dashed"),
              colour_categories = c(1,2),
              colour_labels = c("High M", "Medium M"),
              colours = fq_palette("alisecolours")[1:2])
```

## Example 3: Management plot

Finally let's explore the management plot. You'll notice that there is no `prep` file for this plot. 

Start by explore requirements for `managementplot`:
```{r management1, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
?managementplot
```

We require a vector of management actions, each beginning with the year it happened. We also need a vector of the vertical position of each of these actions. 

```{r management2, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
management_text <- c(
"1980: Management measure",
"1988: Management measure",
"2004: - Many things \n - happened in \n - this year",
"2010: Management measure",
"2021: - Many things \n - happened in \n - this year")

management_pos <- c(0.8, 0.6, 1.0, 0.5, 0.2)
```

The data set is build using either the `biomassplot_prep_DD` or `biomassplot_prep_SS` function, depending on the stock assessment model you used. 

```{r management3, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
data <- biomassplot_prep_SS(ss_mle)
# OR: data <- biomassplot_prep_SS(ss_mle, ss_mcmc)
# OR: data <- biomassplot_prep_DD(dd_mle)
# OR: data <- biomassplot_prep_DD(dd_mle, dd_mcmc, dd_sim)
```

There are several steps that happen in the background when producing this plot, including overlaying a logo and potentally infographics. For this reason, the plot is output as a PNG file.

There is a lot of customization available for the plot.

To produce a management plot with a base case (scenario 1), result found, and the cloud is determined from the base case uncertainty:
```{r management4, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
managementplot(data, management_text, management_pos, base_case = 1, show_result = TRUE, scenarios = 1)
```

To add a custom reference line:
```{r management5, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
managementplot(data, management_text, management_pos, base_case = 1, show_result = TRUE, scenarios = 1,
               custom_reference_values = c(0.4), custom_reference_colours = c("#FFC000"), custom_reference_labels = c('paste(B[40*"%"]~target~reference~point)'))
```


To remove the draft watermark:
```{r management6, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
managementplot(data, management_text, management_pos, base_case = 1, show_result = TRUE, scenarios = 1,
               draft_text = NA)
```

To add an infographic:
```{r management7, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
tmp <- "file/path/infographic.png"
managementplot(data, management_text, management_pos, base_case = 1, show_result = TRUE, scenarios = 1,
               infographic_path = tmp, infographic_position = c(0.5,0.4), infographic_scale = 10)
```

To produce a management plot with a base case (scenario 1), result found, and the cloud is determined from scenario uncertainty:
```{r management8, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
managementplot(data, management_text, management_pos, base_case = 1, show_result = TRUE, scenarios = unique(data$scenario))
```

To produce a management plot where no result was found (and therefore no base case), so the cloud is replaced with individual spaghetti strands:
```{r management9, include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
managementplot(data,management_text, management_pos, base_case = NA, show_result = FALSE, scenarios = unique(data$scenario))
```
